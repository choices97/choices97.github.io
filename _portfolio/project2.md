We propose secure max-min fairness (MMF) precoding for a downlink multi-antenna system with multiple users and eavesdroppers. Since the problem is non-convex and non-smooth and partial channel knowledge is assumed, it is highly challenging to solve. To resolve the difficulties, we first reformulate the problem with conditional average rates, allowing to exploit the partial channel knowledge. Then, we derive the original problem as an approximate smoothing problem using a LogSumExp approach. We identify the first-order optimality condition and cast it to a generalized eigenvalue problem. Solving the problem via a power iteration offers the best local optimal solution. Simulations validate the proposed secure-MMF precoding method.
