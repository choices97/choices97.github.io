In physical layer security, two representative transmission schemes are known to enhance the secrecy spectral efficiency: secure precoding and artificial noise. So far, these two methods have been separately investigated. Bridging these methods, we propose joint design of artificial noise and secure precoding for downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In particular, we consider a multiple eavesdroppers environment where arbitrary number of eavesdropper attempts to overhear the transmitted signal without colluding.
In this setup, we formulate a sum secrecy spectral efficiency optimization problem regarding secure precoding vectors and artificial noise covariance matrix. Since this problem is non-convex and non-smooth, however, solving the problem is challenging. 

To resolve this difficulty, we first tightly approximate the sum secrecy spectral efficiency by using its smooth approximation, and reformulate it into a tractable non-convex function. Then, we derive the first-order optimality condition for the non-convex optimization and develop a low complexity algorithm to find a sub-optimal stationary solution. In addition to that, we also generalize it when the eavesdroppers' statistical channel state information is known. Via simulation, we show that the proposed methods provide significant performance improvements in terms of the sum secrecy spectral efficiency compared to the existing methods under various system setups. One distinguishable merit of the proposed secure precoding method is that it is applicable in general MU-MIMO system environments, e.g., an arbitrary number of users, eavesdroppers, or any set of confidential information.
