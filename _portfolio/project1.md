 Secure precoding superimposed  with artificial noise (AN) is a promising transmission technique to improve security by harnessing the superposition nature of the wireless medium. However, finding a jointly optimal precoding and AN structure is very challenging in downlink multi-user multiple-input  multiple-output (MU-MIMO) wiretap channels with multiple eavesdroppers. The major challenge in maximizing the secrecy rate arises from the non-convexity and non-smoothness of the rate function. Traditionally, an alternating optimization framework that identifies beamforming vectors and AN covariance matrix has been adopted; yet this alternating approach has  limitations in maximizing the secrecy rate. In this paper, we put forth a novel secure precoding algorithm that jointly and simultaneously optimizes the beams and AN covariance matrix for maximizing the secrecy rate when a transmitter has either perfect or partial channel knowledge of eavesdroppers. To this end, we first establish an approximate secrecy rate in a smooth function. Then, we derive the first-order optimality condition in the form of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem (NEP). We present a computationally efficient algorithm to identify the principal eigenvector of the NEP as a suboptimal solution for secure precoding. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods improve secrecy rate significantly compared to the existing secure precoding methods.
